- **Product Display**: Products are displayed in a grid format with images, titles, prices, and ratings.
- **Responsive Design**: The layout is responsive, adjusting to different screen sizes for optimal viewing on desktops, tablets, and mobile devices.
- **Footer**: The footer section contains links to various informational pages, similar to Amazon's footer.

## Technologies Used

- **HTML5**: Markup language used for structuring the content.
- **CSS3**: Styling language used for designing the appearance and layout.

- **styles.css**: The CSS file containing all the styles and design elements.
